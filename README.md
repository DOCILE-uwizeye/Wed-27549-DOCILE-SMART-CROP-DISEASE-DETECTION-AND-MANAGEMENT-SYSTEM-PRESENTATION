# Phase II: Business Process Modeling
## Project: Smart Crop Disease Detection & Management System

---

## 1. Scope Definition
### **Business Process Covered:**  
The process models how a farmer uploads a crop image, how the system analyzes it, detects disease, stores the scan, and generates recommendations.

### **Objectives**
- Detect crop diseases using automated image analysis.
- Provide farmers with treatment and prevention.
- Store historical scans for future tracking.
- Support decision-making using MIS functions.

### **Expected Outcomes**
- Faster and accurate disease detection.
- Better crop health monitoring.
- Increased agricultural productivity.
- Structured data for analytics.

---

## 2. Key Entities & Actors
### **Users**
- Farmers (upload images, view results)
- System admin (manages disease profiles)
- System engine (AI detection logic)

### **Departments / Systems**
- Image Processing Component
- Disease Knowledge Base
- Recommendations Engine
- Database Storage
- Notification/Results System

### **Roles & Responsibilities**
| Actor | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Farmer | Uploads crop image, views diagnosis |
| System Engine | Analyzes image, detects disease |
| Database | Stores users, scans, diseases, history |
| Admin | Updates disease profiles & recommendations |

---

## 3. Business Process (Swimlane Description)
### **Swimlanes**
- Farmer
- Detection System
- Database
- Recommendation Engine

### **Process Flow (Text Description of Diagram)**
1. **Farmer uploads leaf image.**
2. System receives image → preprocesses it.
3. AI model analyzes leaf → detects disease.
4. System retrieves disease details from the database.
5. System generates treatment & prevention recommendations.
6. System stores scan + results in database.
7. Farmer receives disease report and recommendation.

---

## 4. BPMN/UML Notations Used
- **Start Event:** Upload image  
- **Tasks:** Analyze image, fetch disease info, store scan, generate recommendation  
- **Decision Point:** Is a disease detected?  
- **End Event:** Results displayed  
- **Data Stores:** Users, disease_profiles, scans, recommendations  

---

## 5. Logical Flow Validation
- Fully linear from image upload → analysis → results.
- Decision paths clear (diseased or healthy).
- No missing dependencies.
- All actors have defined responsibilities.

---
